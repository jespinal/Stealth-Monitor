## Stealth-Monitor

This repo was created with historical/documentation purposes. The idea was to keep a record of a solution once used due to the need of having a bash script running on a couple of Linux boxes taking periodical screenshots and sending them to a configured destination.

The script had to run stealthy, take a snapshot of whatever was present in the screen, and upload it to an FTP server.
